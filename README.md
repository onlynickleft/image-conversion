This basic application will take supported images and convert then to either a JPEG, WEBP, or PNG image format. 

All conversions are done on the client side with the option to upload to the server (a simple PHP script is used here but any server side language can be used obviously).

Only the main script `main.js` needs to be called as it imports the additional scripts. An IIFE starts the app.
